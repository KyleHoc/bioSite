                    <p>&#x2022; Though he may say that work is also his hobby, Jeremy has a lifelong fascination with history; in his free time, he enjoys reading books about the rich and 
                        detailed history of countries from around the world, particularly those concerning wars from the distant past (his favorite is the Peloponnesian War, just 
                        ask him). In tune with this, he and his wife Kelsey like to occasionally take trips abroad, visiting countries like Germany and Italy to take in their culture
                         and witness historical sites with their own eyes.</p>

                <section class="hobby2">
                    <p>&#x2022; Gaming is another one of Jeremy’s hobbies. When he’s not developing websites, Jeremy enjoys playing strategy games, particularly those involving real-life military
                        conflicts; the <i>Cossacks</i> series of strategy games on PC was a huge inspiration for him in his youth, helping to foster his love of history. He also likes shooters, 
                        <i>Souls</i> games, and is a fan of multiplayer games he can play with others, such as <i>Halo</i>, <i>Gang Beasts</i>, and <i>Golf With Friends</i>. He’ll often hold an online Game Night
                         on Friday evenings as an opportunity to spend time with friends and family.</p>

                <section class="hobby3">
                    <p>&#x2022; And although he never planned on it, Jeremy and Kelsey have a total of five cats, Magnus, Thea, Nyx, Titus, and Flynn, all of which were originally
                         newborn kittens that they found as strays. You could say that all these timid furballs invited themselves into Jeremy’s life and not the other way around,
                          but apart from all the cat hair, her certainly doesn’t mind.</p>
