                <div class="bio"><p>Born in the small town of Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, Jeremy Travis has had a long-lasting interest in web development and design. As early as high school he had already built a very simplistic website where he and his friends could chat and post about games they’ve been playing, paving the road for his eventual career as a professional web developer. 
                    After graduating from the University of Scranton with a degree in Electronic Commerce and Operations Management, Jeremy learned web development through resources like Microsoft Developer and Pluralsight.com, and then used the skills he had acquired to pursue a career. He later moved to Sydney, NY, where he got as position as a Full Stack Developer at Amphenol Aerospace, where he eventually became a Web Development Manager.

                <p>Throughout his career, Jeremy has made many websites both for his job and on the side (see above), including Amphenol Aerospace’s corporate site, a site for Awestruck Cider, and Kelsey Travis Photography, which is his wife’s wedding photography business.
                    Jeremy’s favorite thing about web development is being able to impress people by showing them the pages and interfaces he’s developed, getting to see them appreciate the work he put into developing new features for a site. Though he admits that the profession can be difficult at times, mainly when instructions are unclear and it’s tricky to figure out what people want, Jeremy is very enthusiastic about his field and encourages new developers to dive right in, to use the resources that are out there, and to seek out projects they enjoy.
                    Currently, Jeremy is a Senior Software Engineer working from home for the Connecticut-based software company ebbo.</p>
